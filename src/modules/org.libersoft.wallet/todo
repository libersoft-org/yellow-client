  Critical Issues

  1. Broken Transaction Serialization (ledger.ts:350-363)
  - The serializeTransaction function is fundamentally flawed and doesn't produce valid RLP encoding
  - Uses incorrect length encoding and field concatenation
  - Will cause transaction signing failures

  2. UI Not Implemented (SettingsWalletsAddHWWalletLedger.svelte)
  - Shows "Coming Soon" placeholder instead of actual functionality
  - Ledger integration exists in backend but no UI to use it

  Security Concerns

  3. No Input Validation
  - Transaction fields aren't validated before signing
  - Missing checks for malformed addresses or amounts
  - Could lead to signing invalid transactions

  4. Device ID Generation (ledger.ts:52)
  - Uses simple concatenation of productId + vendorId
  - Not cryptographically secure for device identification

  5. Memory Leaks
  - Store subscriptions created but not always properly cleaned up
  - waitForLedgerConnection function has potential memory leaks

  Best Practice Issues

  6. Missing EIP-1559 Support
  - supportsEIP1559 function exists but isn't integrated
  - Modern transactions may fail on newer networks

  7. No Tests
  - Zero test coverage for critical financial operations
  - No validation of signing logic

  8. Error Handling
  - Generic error messages provide poor UX
  - Some async operations lack proper error boundaries

  9. Missing Dependencies
  - Code references @ethereumjs/rlp in comments but doesn't use it
  - Should use proper RLP encoding library

  Recommendations

  1. Fix transaction serialization - Use @ethereumjs/rlp or similar
  2. Implement proper UI - Connect backend to frontend
  3. Add comprehensive tests - Especially for signing operations
  4. Improve error handling - More specific error messages
  5. Add input validation - Validate all transaction parameters
  6. Fix memory management - Properly cleanup subscriptions
